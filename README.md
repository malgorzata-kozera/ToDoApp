Here you can create your personalized tasks list.
=======
I made this app as part of the exercises, I wanted to improve my skills in django and python in general,
because there is still a lot of things that can be done better :) 
And by the way I really like to be well organized, so making this app was a real pleasure for me :) 
Check it out [here](https://tasks-list-app.herokuapp.com).
