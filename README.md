# ToDo App
Here you can create your personalized tasks list. 
I made this app as part of the exercises, I wanted to improve my skills in django and python in general,
because there is still a lot of things that can be done better :) 
And by the way I really like to be well organized, so making this app was a real pleasure for me :) 

## Technology Stack:
-	Python/Django
-	HTML5/CSS/Bootstrap4

## What can you do:
- add a new tasks
- mark them as an completed (nothing better than a view of all tasks done !)
- delete completed tasks
- delete all tasks
- create your own user
- update your profile
- reset the password
